## Branches

The project uses the following branches:

 - The `main` branch. This is our default branch and is the base branch for PRs and code commits.
 - The `vendor` branch is kept up-to-date with the elementary OS Files app `master` branch.

We will create other branches as we go for PRs and feature requests.

Contributions are very welcome!
